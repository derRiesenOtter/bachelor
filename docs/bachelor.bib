	abstract = {The burgeoning comprehension of protein phase separation ({PS}) has ushered in a wealth of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of phase-separating proteins ({PSPs}). These tools often skew towards {PSPs} with a high content of intrinsically disordered regions ({IDRs}), thus frequently undervaluing potential {PSPs} without {IDRs}. Nonetheless, {PS} is not only steered by {IDRs} but also by the structured modular domains and interactions that aren’t necessarily reflected in amino acid sequences. In this work, we introduce {PSPire}, a machine learning predictor that incorporates both residue-level and structure-level features for the precise prediction of {PSPs}. Compared to current {PSP} predictors, {PSPire} shows a notable improvement in identifying {PSPs} without {IDRs}, which underscores the crucial role of non-{IDR}, structure-based characteristics in multivalent interactions throughout the {PS} process. Additionally, our biological validation experiments substantiate the predictive capacity of {PSPire}, with 9 out of 11 chosen candidate {PSPs} confirmed to form condensates within cells.},

	abstract = {Protein self-assembly is one of the formation mechanisms of biomolecular condensates. However, most phase-separating systems ({PS}) demand multiple partners in biological conditions. In this study, we divided {PS} proteins into two groups according to the mechanism by which they undergo {PS}: {PS}-Self proteins can self-assemble spontaneously to form droplets, while {PS}-Part proteins interact with partners to undergo {PS}. Analysis of the amino acid composition revealed differences in the sequence pattern between the two protein groups. Existing {PS} predictors, when evaluated on two test protein sets, preferentially predicted self-assembling proteins. Thus, a comprehensive predictor is required. Herein, we propose that properties other than sequence composition can provide crucial information in screening {PS} proteins. By incorporating phosphorylation frequencies and immunofluorescence image-based droplet-forming propensity with other {PS}-related features, we built two independent machine-learning models to separately predict the two protein categories. Results of independent testing suggested the superiority of integrating multimodal features. We performed experimental verification on the top-scored proteins {DHX}9, Ki-67, and {NIFK}. Their {PS} behavior in vitro revealed the effectiveness of our models in {PS} prediction. Further validation on the proteome of membraneless organelles confirmed the ability of our models to identify {PS}-Part proteins. We implemented a web server named {PhaSePred} (http://predict.phasep.pro/) that incorporates our two models together with representative {PS} predictors. {PhaSePred} displays proteome-level quantiles of different features, thus profiling {PS} propensity and providing crucial information for identification of candidate proteins.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of {AlphaFold} is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) have been central to the Deep Learning revolution and played a key role in initiating the new age of Artificial Intelligence. However, in recent years newer architectures such as Transformers have dominated both research and practical applications. While {CNNs} still play critical roles in many of the newer developments such as Generative {AI}, they are far from being thoroughly understood and utilised to their full potential. Here we show that {CNNs} can recognise patterns in images with scattered pixels and can be used to analyse complex datasets by transforming them into pseudo images with minimal processing for any high dimensional dataset, representing a more general approach to the application of {CNNs} to datasets such as in molecular biology, text, and speech. We introduce a pipeline called {DeepMapper}, which allows analysis of very high dimensional datasets without intermediate filtering and dimension reduction, thus preserving the full texture of the data, enabling detection of small variations normally deemed ‘noise’. We demonstrate that {DeepMapper} can identify very small perturbations in large datasets with mostly random variables, and that it is superior in speed and on par in accuracy to prior work in processing large datasets with large numbers of features.},

	abstract = {Background Proteins self-organize in dynamic cellular environments by assembling into reversible biomolecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation ({LLPS}). These condensates can comprise single or multiple proteins, with different roles in the ensemble\&amp;rsquo;s structural and functional integrity. Driver proteins form condensates autonomously, while client proteins just localize within them. Although several databases exist to catalog proteins undergoing {LLPS}, they often contain divergent data that impedes interoperability between these resources. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on selecting proteins without explicit experimental association with condensates (non-{LLPS} proteins or negative data). These two aspects have prevented the generation of reliable predictive models and fair benchmarks.Results In this work, we used an integrated biocuration protocol to analyze information from all relevant {LLPS} databases and generate confident datasets of client and driver proteins. Besides, we introduce standardized negative datasets, encompassing both globular and disordered proteins. To validate our datasets, we investigated specific physicochemical traits related to {LLPS} across different subsets of protein sequences. We observed significant differences not only between positive and negative instances but also among {LLPS} proteins themselves. The datasets from this study are publicly available as a website at https://llpsdatasets.ppmclab.com and as a data repository at https://github.com/{PPMC}-lab/llps-datasets.Conclusions Our datasets offer a reliable means for confidently assessing the specific roles of proteins in {LLPS} and identifying key differences in physicochemical properties underlying this process. These high-confidence datasets are poised to train a new generation of multilabel models, build more standardized benchmarks, and mitigate sequential biases associated with the presence of intrinsically disordered regions.},

	abstract = {Membraneless organelles ({MOs}) are dynamic liquid condensates that host a variety of specific cellular processes, such as ribosome biogenesis or {RNA} degradation. {MOs} form through liquid–liquid phase separation ({LLPS}), a process that relies on multivalent weak interactions of the constituent proteins and other macromolecules. Since the first discoveries of certain proteins being able to drive {LLPS}, it emerged as a general mechanism for the effective organization of cellular space that is exploited in all kingdoms of life. While numerous experimental studies report novel cases, the computational identification of {LLPS} drivers is lagging behind, and many open questions remain about the sequence determinants, composition, regulation and biological relevance of the resulting condensates. Our limited ability to overcome these issues is largely due to the lack of a dedicated {LLPS} database. Therefore, here we introduce {PhaSePro} (https://phasepro.elte.hu), an openly accessible, comprehensive, manually curated database of experimentally validated {LLPS} driver proteins/protein regions. It not only provides a wealth of information on such systems, but improves the standardization of data by introducing novel {LLPS}-specific controlled vocabularies. {PhaSePro} can be accessed through an appealing, user-friendly interface and thus has definite potential to become the central resource in this dynamically developing field.},

	abstract = {Phase separation ({PS}) proteins form droplets to regulate myriad membraneless organelles ({MLOs}) and cellular pathways such as transcription, signaling transduction and protein degeneration. {PS} droplets are usually liquid-like and can convert to hydrogel/solid-like under certain conditions. The {PS} behavior of proteins is regulated by co-{PS} partners and mutations, modifications, oligomerizations, repeat regions and alternative splicing of the proteins. With growing interest in {PS} condensates and associated proteins, we established {PhaSepDB} 1.0, which provided experimentally verified {PS} proteins and {MLO}-related proteins. The past few years witnessed a surge in {PS}-related research works; thus, we kept updating {PhaSepDB}. The current {PhaSepDB} contains 1419 {PS} entries, 770 low-throughput {MLO}-related entries and 7303 high-throughput {MLO}-related entries. We provided more detailed annotations of {PS} proteins, including {PS} verification experiments, regions used in experiments, phase diagrams of different experimental conditions, droplet states, co-{PS} partners and {PS} regulatory information. We believe that researchers can go further in studying {PS} proteins with the updated {PhaSepDB} (http://db.phasep.pro/).},

	abstract = {Emerging evidences have suggested that liquid–liquid phase separation ({LLPS}) of proteins plays a vital role both in a wide range of biological processes and in related diseases. Whether a protein undergoes phase separation not only is determined by the chemical and physical properties of biomolecule themselves, but also is regulated by environmental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, {pH}, as well as volume excluded by other macromolecules. A web accessible database {LLPSDB} was developed recently by our group, in which all the proteins involved in {LLPS} in vitro as well as corresponding experimental conditions were curated comprehensively from published literatures. With the rapid increase of investigations in biomolecular {LLPS} and growing popularity of {LLPSDB}, we updated the database, and developed a new version {LLPSDB} v2.0. In comparison of the previously released version, more than double contents of data are curated, and a new class ‘Ambiguous system’ is added. In addition, the web interface is improved, such as that users can search the database by selecting option ‘phase separation status’ alone or combined with other options. We anticipate that this updated database will serve as a more comprehensive and helpful resource for users.{LLPSDB} v2.0 is freely available at: http://bio-comp.org.cn/llpsdbv2.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

From the literature, we manually collected 150 scaffold proteins that are drivers of {LLPS}, 987 regulators that contribute in modulating {LLPS}, and 8148 potential client proteins that might be dispensable for the formation of {MLOs}, which were then categorized into 40 biomolecular condensates. We searched potential orthologs of these known proteins, and in total {DrLLPS} contained 437 887 known and potential {LLPS}-associated proteins in 164 eukaryotes. Furthermore, we carefully annotated {LLPS}-associated proteins in eight model organisms, by using the knowledge integrated from 110 widely used resources that covered 16 aspects, including protein disordered regions, domain annotations, post-translational modifications ({PTMs}), genetic variations, cancer mutations, molecular interactions, disease-associated information, drug-target relations, physicochemical property, protein functional annotations, protein expressions/proteomics, protein 3D structures, subcellular localizations, {mRNA} expressions, {DNA} \&amp; {RNA} elements, and {DNA} methylations.

	abstract = {{DisProt} ({URL}: https://disprot.org) is the gold standard database for intrinsically disordered proteins and regions, providing valuable information about their functions. The latest version of {DisProt} brings significant advancements, including a broader representation of functions and an enhanced curation process. These improvements aim to increase both the quality of annotations and their coverage at the sequence level. Higher coverage has been achieved by adopting additional evidence codes. Quality of annotations has been improved by systematically applying Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments ({MIADE}) principles and reporting all the details of the experimental setup that could potentially influence the structural state of a protein. The {DisProt} database now includes new thematic datasets and has expanded the adoption of Gene Ontology terms, resulting in an extensive functional repertoire which is automatically propagated to {UniProtKB}. Finally, we show that {DisProt}'s curated annotations strongly correlate with disorder predictions inferred from {AlphaFold}2 {pLDDT} (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) confidence scores. This comparison highlights the utility of {DisProt} in explaining apparent uncertainty of certain well-defined predicted structures, which often correspond to folding-upon-binding fragments. Overall, {DisProt} serves as a comprehensive resource, combining experimental evidence of disorder information to enhance our understanding of intrinsically disordered proteins and their functional implications.},

	abstract = {Protein phase separation is implicated in formation of membraneless organelles, signaling puncta and the nuclear pore. Multivalent interactions of modular binding domains and their target motifs can drive phase separation. However, forces promoting the more common phase separation of intrinsically disordered regions are less understood, with suggested roles for multivalent cation-pi, pi-pi, and charge interactions and the hydrophobic effect. Known phase-separating proteins are enriched in pi-orbital containing residues and thus we analyzed pi-interactions in folded proteins. We found that pi-pi interactions involving non-aromatic groups are widespread, underestimated by force-fields used in structure calculations and correlated with solvation and lack of regular secondary structure, properties associated with disordered regions. We present a phase separation predictive algorithm based on pi interaction frequency, highlighting proteins involved in biomaterials and {RNA} processing.},

Recent studies showed that cells can also trigger the formation of membraneless organelles composed by phase-separated proteins to respond to various stimuli. These condensates provide new ways to control the reactions and phase-separation proteins ({PSPs}) are thus revolutionizing how cellular organization is conceived. The small number of experimentally validated proteins, and the difficulty in discovering them, remain bottlenecks in {PSPs} research.Here we present {PSPer}, the first in-silico screening tool for prion-like {RNA}-binding {PSPs}. We show that it can prioritize {PSPs} among proteins containing similar {RNA}-binding domains, intrinsically disordered regions and prions. {PSPer} is thus suitable to screen proteomes, identifying the most likely {PSPs} for further experimental investigation. Moreover, its predictions are fully interpretable in the sense that it assigns specific functional regions to the predicted proteins, providing valuable information for experimental investigation of targeted mutations on these regions. Finally, we show that it can estimate the ability of artificially designed proteins to form condensates (r=−0.87), thus providing an in-silico screening tool for protein design experiments.{PSPer} is available at bio2byte.com/psp.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {A wide range of proteins have been reported to condensate into a dense liquid phase, forming a reversible droplet state. Failure in the control of the droplet state can lead to the formation of the more stable amyloid state, which is often disease-related. These observations prompt the question of how many proteins can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation. Here, in order to address this problem, we discuss the biophysical principles underlying the droplet state of proteins by analyzing current evidence for droplet-driver and droplet-client proteins. Based on the concept that the droplet state is stabilized by the large conformational entropy associated with nonspecific side-chain interactions, we develop the {FuzDrop} method to predict droplet-promoting regions and proteins, which can spontaneously phase separate. We use this approach to carry out a proteome-level study to rank proteins according to their propensity to form the droplet state, spontaneously or via partner interactions. Our results lead to the conclusion that the droplet state could be, at least transiently, accessible to most proteins under conditions found in the cellular environment.},

In vivo and in vitro validations demonstrate that truncating just 6 key residues in {GATA}3 disrupts phase separation, enhancing tumor cell migration and inhibiting growth. Glycine and its motifs are enriched in spacer and key residues, as revealed by our comprehensive analysis. {PSPHunter} identifies nearly 80\% of disease-associated phase-separating proteins, with frequent mutated pathological residues like glycine and proline often residing in these key residues. {PSPHunter} thus emerges as a crucial tool to uncover key residues, facilitating insights into phase separation mechanisms governing transcriptional control, cell fate transitions, and disease development.},

Stress granules are stress-induced biological assemblies that are of keen interest due to being linked to both long-term cell viability and a variety of protein aggregation-based diseases. Herein, we compile recently published stress granule composition data, formed specifically through heat and oxidative stress, for both mammalian (Homo sapiens) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells. Interrogation of the data reveals that stress granule proteins are enriched in features that favor protein liquid-liquid phase separation, being highly disordered, soluble, and abundant while maintaining a high level of protein-protein interactions under basal conditions. Furthermore, these “stress granuleomes” are shown to be enriched for multidomained, {RNA}-binding proteins with increased potential for post-translational modifications. Findings are consistent with the notion that stress granule formation is driven by protein liquid-liquid phase separation. Furthermore, stress granule proteins appear poised near solubility limits while possessing the ability to dynamically alter their phase behavior in response to external threat. Interestingly, several features, such as protein disorder, are more prominent among stress granule proteins that share homologs between yeast and mammalian systems also found within stress-induced foci. We culminate results from our stress granule analysis into novel predictors for granule incorporation and validate the mammalian predictor's performance against multiple types of membraneless condensates and by colocalization microscopy.},

Extensive experimental validation of 24 positive predictions in cellulo shows an overall {\textasciitilde}82\% accuracy regardless of the structural disorder content of the tested proteins. While increasing disorder content is associated with organismal complexity, our analysis of 26 species reveals no correlation between predicted condensate proteome content and disorder content across organisms. Overall, we present a machine learning classifier to interrogate condensate components at whole-proteome levels across the tree of life.},

We identify the best-performing architectures by varying {CNN} width, depth and pooling designs. We find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif-based tasks. We show the benefits of {CNNs} in learning rich higher-order sequence features, such as secondary motifs and local sequence context, by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty. We also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark datasets, using approaches that control potentially confounding effects like positional or motif strength bias, is critical in making fair comparisons between competing methods. We explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks, and we have created a flexible cloud-based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural network architectures for problems in computational biology.Availability and Implementation: All the models analyzed are available at http://cnn.csail.mit.edu.Contact:  gifford@mit.{eduSupplementary} information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, the main goal of any neural network is to transform the non-linearly separable input data into more linearly separable abstract features using a hierarchy of layers. These layers are combinations of linear and nonlinear functions. The most popular and common non-linearity layers are activation functions ({AFs}), such as Logistic Sigmoid, Tanh, {ReLU}, {ELU}, Swish and Mish. In this paper, a comprehensive overview and survey is presented for {AFs} in neural networks for deep learning. Different classes of {AFs} such as Logistic Sigmoid and Tanh based, {ReLU} based, {ELU} based, and Learning based are covered. Several characteristics of {AFs} such as output range, monotonicity, and smoothness are also pointed out. A performance comparison is also performed among 18 state-of-the-art {AFs} with different networks on different types of data. The insights of {AFs} are presented to benefit the researchers for doing further research and practitioners to select among different choices.

	abstract = {Short term load forecasting is one of the important problems in power system. Accurate forecasting results can improve the flexibility of power market and resource utilization efficiency, which is of great significance to the efficient operation of power system.A short-term power load forecasting model based on feature selection and error correction is proposed to address the problems of low accuracy and weak generalization ability of short-term power load forecasting. The coarse set of features is firstly screened by using Maximal Information Coefficient ({MIC}), and then the fine set of key features affecting load forecasting is screened by using {LightGBM} and {XGboost} feature selection algorithms respectively. The corresponding fine set of features and historical loads are input into {LightGBM} and {XGboost} models with powerful prediction function for prediction, and use the predicted value to correct the error and complete the load prediction. The experimental results show that the improved model has higher prediction accuracy,and this method is applicable to the prediction of all periods of the year, with good portability and robustness.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Proteins and nucleic acids are compartmentalized into micron-scale membrane-less droplets via {LLPS}. These droplets, termed biomolecular condensates, are highly dynamic, have concentrated components, and perform specific functions. Biomolecular condensates have been observed to organize diverse key biological processes, including gene transcription, signal transduction, {DNA} damage repair, chromatin organization, and autophagy. The dysregulation of these biological activities owing to aberrant {LLPS} is important in cardiovascular diseases. This review provides a detailed overview of the regulation and functions of biomolecular condensates, provides a comprehensive depiction of {LLPS} in several common cardiovascular diseases, and discusses the revolutionary therapeutic perspective of modulating {LLPS} in cardiovascular diseases and new treatment strategies relevant to {LLPS}.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins carry out various biological functions while lacking ordered secondary and/or tertiary structure. In order to find general intrinsic properties of amino acid residues that are responsible for the absence of ordered structure in intrinsically disordered proteins we surveyed 517 amino acid scales. Each of these scales was taken as an independent attribute for the subsequent analysis. For a given attribute value X, which is averaged over a consecutive string of amino acids, and for a given data set having both ordered and disordered segments, the conditional probabilities P(so {\textbar} x) and P(sd {\textbar} x) for order and disorder, respectively, can be determined for all possible values of X. Plots of the conditional probabilities P(so {\textbar} x) and P(sd {\textbar} x) versus X give a pair of curves. The area between these two curves divided by the total area of the graph gives the area ratio value ({ARV}), which is proportional to the degree of separation of the two probability curves and, therefore, provides a measure of the given attribute’s power to discriminate between order and disorder. As {ARV} falls between zero and one, larger {ARV} corresponds to the better discrimination between order and disorder. Starting from the scale with the highest {ARV}, we applied a simulated annealing procedure to search for alternative scale values and have managed to increase the {ARV} by more than 10\%. The ranking of the amino acids in this new {TOP}-{IDP} scale is as follows (from order promoting to disorder promoting): W, F, Y, I, M, L, V, N, C, T, A, G, R, D, H, Q, K, S, E, P. A web-based server has been created to apply the {TOP}-{IDP} scale to predict intrinsically disordered proteins (http://www.disprot.org/dev/disindex.php).},

Arginine can interact with nucleotide bases via hydrogen bonding and π-stacking; thus, nucleotide conformers that provide access to the bases provide enhanced opportunities for {RGG} interactions. Methylation of {RGG}/{RG} regions, which is accomplished by protein arginine methyltransferase enzymes, occurs to different degrees in different cell types and may regulate the behavior of proteins containing these regions.},

The implications of this novel principle of cellular organization are vast and can be applied at multiple scales, spawning exciting research questions in numerous directions. Of fundamental importance are the molecular mechanisms that underly biomolecular condensate formation within cells and whether insights gained into these mechanisms provide a gateway for accurate predictions of protein phase behavior. Within the last six years, a significant number of predictors for protein phase separation and condensate localization have emerged. Herein, we compare a collection of state-of-the-art predictors on different tasks related to protein phase behavior. We show that the tested methods achieve high {AUCs} in the identification of biomolecular condensate drivers and scaffolds, as well as in the identification of proteins able to phase separate in vitro. However, our benchmark tests reveal that their performance is poorer when used to predict protein segments that are involved in phase separation or to classify amino acid substitutions as phase-separation-promoting or -inhibiting mutations. Our results suggest that the phenomenological approach used by most predictors is insufficient to fully grasp the complexity of the phenomenon within biological contexts and make reliable predictions related to protein phase behavior at the residue level.},

It can be used for both classification and non-classification models including graph-structured models built on Neural Networks ({NN}). In this paper we give a high-level overview of supported attribution algorithms and show how to perform memory-efficient and scalable computations. We emphasize that the three main characteristics of the library are multimodality, extensibility and ease of use. Multimodality supports different modality of inputs such as image, text, audio or video. Extensibility allows adding new algorithms and features. The library is also designed for easy understanding and use. Besides, we also introduce an interactive visualization tool called Captum Insights that is built on top of Captum library and allows sample-based model debugging and visualization using feature importance metrics.},
