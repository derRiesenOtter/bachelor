	abstract = {The burgeoning comprehension of protein phase separation ({PS}) has ushered in a wealth of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of phase-separating proteins ({PSPs}). These tools often skew towards {PSPs} with a high content of intrinsically disordered regions ({IDRs}), thus frequently undervaluing potential {PSPs} without {IDRs}. Nonetheless, {PS} is not only steered by {IDRs} but also by the structured modular domains and interactions that aren’t necessarily reflected in amino acid sequences. In this work, we introduce {PSPire}, a machine learning predictor that incorporates both residue-level and structure-level features for the precise prediction of {PSPs}. Compared to current {PSP} predictors, {PSPire} shows a notable improvement in identifying {PSPs} without {IDRs}, which underscores the crucial role of non-{IDR}, structure-based characteristics in multivalent interactions throughout the {PS} process. Additionally, our biological validation experiments substantiate the predictive capacity of {PSPire}, with 9 out of 11 chosen candidate {PSPs} confirmed to form condensates within cells.},

	abstract = {Protein self-assembly is one of the formation mechanisms of biomolecular condensates. However, most phase-separating systems ({PS}) demand multiple partners in biological conditions. In this study, we divided {PS} proteins into two groups according to the mechanism by which they undergo {PS}: {PS}-Self proteins can self-assemble spontaneously to form droplets, while {PS}-Part proteins interact with partners to undergo {PS}. Analysis of the amino acid composition revealed differences in the sequence pattern between the two protein groups. Existing {PS} predictors, when evaluated on two test protein sets, preferentially predicted self-assembling proteins. Thus, a comprehensive predictor is required. Herein, we propose that properties other than sequence composition can provide crucial information in screening {PS} proteins. By incorporating phosphorylation frequencies and immunofluorescence image-based droplet-forming propensity with other {PS}-related features, we built two independent machine-learning models to separately predict the two protein categories. Results of independent testing suggested the superiority of integrating multimodal features. We performed experimental verification on the top-scored proteins {DHX}9, Ki-67, and {NIFK}. Their {PS} behavior in vitro revealed the effectiveness of our models in {PS} prediction. Further validation on the proteome of membraneless organelles confirmed the ability of our models to identify {PS}-Part proteins. We implemented a web server named {PhaSePred} (http://predict.phasep.pro/) that incorporates our two models together with representative {PS} predictors. {PhaSePred} displays proteome-level quantiles of different features, thus profiling {PS} propensity and providing crucial information for identification of candidate proteins.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of {AlphaFold} is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) have been central to the Deep Learning revolution and played a key role in initiating the new age of Artificial Intelligence. However, in recent years newer architectures such as Transformers have dominated both research and practical applications. While {CNNs} still play critical roles in many of the newer developments such as Generative {AI}, they are far from being thoroughly understood and utilised to their full potential. Here we show that {CNNs} can recognise patterns in images with scattered pixels and can be used to analyse complex datasets by transforming them into pseudo images with minimal processing for any high dimensional dataset, representing a more general approach to the application of {CNNs} to datasets such as in molecular biology, text, and speech. We introduce a pipeline called {DeepMapper}, which allows analysis of very high dimensional datasets without intermediate filtering and dimension reduction, thus preserving the full texture of the data, enabling detection of small variations normally deemed ‘noise’. We demonstrate that {DeepMapper} can identify very small perturbations in large datasets with mostly random variables, and that it is superior in speed and on par in accuracy to prior work in processing large datasets with large numbers of features.},

	abstract = {Background Proteins self-organize in dynamic cellular environments by assembling into reversible biomolecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation ({LLPS}). These condensates can comprise single or multiple proteins, with different roles in the ensemble\&amp;rsquo;s structural and functional integrity. Driver proteins form condensates autonomously, while client proteins just localize within them. Although several databases exist to catalog proteins undergoing {LLPS}, they often contain divergent data that impedes interoperability between these resources. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on selecting proteins without explicit experimental association with condensates (non-{LLPS} proteins or negative data). These two aspects have prevented the generation of reliable predictive models and fair benchmarks.Results In this work, we used an integrated biocuration protocol to analyze information from all relevant {LLPS} databases and generate confident datasets of client and driver proteins. Besides, we introduce standardized negative datasets, encompassing both globular and disordered proteins. To validate our datasets, we investigated specific physicochemical traits related to {LLPS} across different subsets of protein sequences. We observed significant differences not only between positive and negative instances but also among {LLPS} proteins themselves. The datasets from this study are publicly available as a website at https://llpsdatasets.ppmclab.com and as a data repository at https://github.com/{PPMC}-lab/llps-datasets.Conclusions Our datasets offer a reliable means for confidently assessing the specific roles of proteins in {LLPS} and identifying key differences in physicochemical properties underlying this process. These high-confidence datasets are poised to train a new generation of multilabel models, build more standardized benchmarks, and mitigate sequential biases associated with the presence of intrinsically disordered regions.},

	abstract = {Membraneless organelles ({MOs}) are dynamic liquid condensates that host a variety of specific cellular processes, such as ribosome biogenesis or {RNA} degradation. {MOs} form through liquid–liquid phase separation ({LLPS}), a process that relies on multivalent weak interactions of the constituent proteins and other macromolecules. Since the first discoveries of certain proteins being able to drive {LLPS}, it emerged as a general mechanism for the effective organization of cellular space that is exploited in all kingdoms of life. While numerous experimental studies report novel cases, the computational identification of {LLPS} drivers is lagging behind, and many open questions remain about the sequence determinants, composition, regulation and biological relevance of the resulting condensates. Our limited ability to overcome these issues is largely due to the lack of a dedicated {LLPS} database. Therefore, here we introduce {PhaSePro} (https://phasepro.elte.hu), an openly accessible, comprehensive, manually curated database of experimentally validated {LLPS} driver proteins/protein regions. It not only provides a wealth of information on such systems, but improves the standardization of data by introducing novel {LLPS}-specific controlled vocabularies. {PhaSePro} can be accessed through an appealing, user-friendly interface and thus has definite potential to become the central resource in this dynamically developing field.},

	abstract = {Phase separation ({PS}) proteins form droplets to regulate myriad membraneless organelles ({MLOs}) and cellular pathways such as transcription, signaling transduction and protein degeneration. {PS} droplets are usually liquid-like and can convert to hydrogel/solid-like under certain conditions. The {PS} behavior of proteins is regulated by co-{PS} partners and mutations, modifications, oligomerizations, repeat regions and alternative splicing of the proteins. With growing interest in {PS} condensates and associated proteins, we established {PhaSepDB} 1.0, which provided experimentally verified {PS} proteins and {MLO}-related proteins. The past few years witnessed a surge in {PS}-related research works; thus, we kept updating {PhaSepDB}. The current {PhaSepDB} contains 1419 {PS} entries, 770 low-throughput {MLO}-related entries and 7303 high-throughput {MLO}-related entries. We provided more detailed annotations of {PS} proteins, including {PS} verification experiments, regions used in experiments, phase diagrams of different experimental conditions, droplet states, co-{PS} partners and {PS} regulatory information. We believe that researchers can go further in studying {PS} proteins with the updated {PhaSepDB} (http://db.phasep.pro/).},

	abstract = {Emerging evidences have suggested that liquid–liquid phase separation ({LLPS}) of proteins plays a vital role both in a wide range of biological processes and in related diseases. Whether a protein undergoes phase separation not only is determined by the chemical and physical properties of biomolecule themselves, but also is regulated by environmental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, {pH}, as well as volume excluded by other macromolecules. A web accessible database {LLPSDB} was developed recently by our group, in which all the proteins involved in {LLPS} in vitro as well as corresponding experimental conditions were curated comprehensively from published literatures. With the rapid increase of investigations in biomolecular {LLPS} and growing popularity of {LLPSDB}, we updated the database, and developed a new version {LLPSDB} v2.0. In comparison of the previously released version, more than double contents of data are curated, and a new class ‘Ambiguous system’ is added. In addition, the web interface is improved, such as that users can search the database by selecting option ‘phase separation status’ alone or combined with other options. We anticipate that this updated database will serve as a more comprehensive and helpful resource for users.{LLPSDB} v2.0 is freely available at: http://bio-comp.org.cn/llpsdbv2.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

From the literature, we manually collected 150 scaffold proteins that are drivers of {LLPS}, 987 regulators that contribute in modulating {LLPS}, and 8148 potential client proteins that might be dispensable for the formation of {MLOs}, which were then categorized into 40 biomolecular condensates. We searched potential orthologs of these known proteins, and in total {DrLLPS} contained 437 887 known and potential {LLPS}-associated proteins in 164 eukaryotes. Furthermore, we carefully annotated {LLPS}-associated proteins in eight model organisms, by using the knowledge integrated from 110 widely used resources that covered 16 aspects, including protein disordered regions, domain annotations, post-translational modifications ({PTMs}), genetic variations, cancer mutations, molecular interactions, disease-associated information, drug-target relations, physicochemical property, protein functional annotations, protein expressions/proteomics, protein 3D structures, subcellular localizations, {mRNA} expressions, {DNA} \&amp; {RNA} elements, and {DNA} methylations.

	abstract = {{DisProt} ({URL}: https://disprot.org) is the gold standard database for intrinsically disordered proteins and regions, providing valuable information about their functions. The latest version of {DisProt} brings significant advancements, including a broader representation of functions and an enhanced curation process. These improvements aim to increase both the quality of annotations and their coverage at the sequence level. Higher coverage has been achieved by adopting additional evidence codes. Quality of annotations has been improved by systematically applying Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments ({MIADE}) principles and reporting all the details of the experimental setup that could potentially influence the structural state of a protein. The {DisProt} database now includes new thematic datasets and has expanded the adoption of Gene Ontology terms, resulting in an extensive functional repertoire which is automatically propagated to {UniProtKB}. Finally, we show that {DisProt}'s curated annotations strongly correlate with disorder predictions inferred from {AlphaFold}2 {pLDDT} (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) confidence scores. This comparison highlights the utility of {DisProt} in explaining apparent uncertainty of certain well-defined predicted structures, which often correspond to folding-upon-binding fragments. Overall, {DisProt} serves as a comprehensive resource, combining experimental evidence of disorder information to enhance our understanding of intrinsically disordered proteins and their functional implications.},

	abstract = {Protein phase separation is implicated in formation of membraneless organelles, signaling puncta and the nuclear pore. Multivalent interactions of modular binding domains and their target motifs can drive phase separation. However, forces promoting the more common phase separation of intrinsically disordered regions are less understood, with suggested roles for multivalent cation-pi, pi-pi, and charge interactions and the hydrophobic effect. Known phase-separating proteins are enriched in pi-orbital containing residues and thus we analyzed pi-interactions in folded proteins. We found that pi-pi interactions involving non-aromatic groups are widespread, underestimated by force-fields used in structure calculations and correlated with solvation and lack of regular secondary structure, properties associated with disordered regions. We present a phase separation predictive algorithm based on pi interaction frequency, highlighting proteins involved in biomaterials and {RNA} processing.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic cells contain different membrane-delimited compartments, which are crucial for the biochemical reactions necessary to sustain cell life. Recent studies showed that cells can also trigger the formation of membraneless organelles composed by phase-separated proteins to respond to various stimuli. These condensates provide new ways to control the reactions and phase-separation proteins ({PSPs}) are thus revolutionizing how cellular organization is conceived. The small number of experimentally validated proteins, and the difficulty in discovering them, remain bottlenecks in {PSPs} research.Here we present {PSPer}, the first in-silico screening tool for prion-like {RNA}-binding {PSPs}. We show that it can prioritize {PSPs} among proteins containing similar {RNA}-binding domains, intrinsically disordered regions and prions. {PSPer} is thus suitable to screen proteomes, identifying the most likely {PSPs} for further experimental investigation. Moreover, its predictions are fully interpretable in the sense that it assigns specific functional regions to the predicted proteins, providing valuable information for experimental investigation of targeted mutations on these regions. Finally, we show that it can estimate the ability of artificially designed proteins to form condensates (r=−0.87), thus providing an in-silico screening tool for protein design experiments.{PSPer} is available at bio2byte.com/psp.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {A wide range of proteins have been reported to condensate into a dense liquid phase, forming a reversible droplet state. Failure in the control of the droplet state can lead to the formation of the more stable amyloid state, which is often disease-related. These observations prompt the question of how many proteins can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation. Here, in order to address this problem, we discuss the biophysical principles underlying the droplet state of proteins by analyzing current evidence for droplet-driver and droplet-client proteins. Based on the concept that the droplet state is stabilized by the large conformational entropy associated with nonspecific side-chain interactions, we develop the {FuzDrop} method to predict droplet-promoting regions and proteins, which can spontaneously phase separate. We use this approach to carry out a proteome-level study to rank proteins according to their propensity to form the droplet state, spontaneously or via partner interactions. Our results lead to the conclusion that the droplet state could be, at least transiently, accessible to most proteins under conditions found in the cellular environment.},

It is prevalent in soft matter, is observed in systems involving polymers, organic molecules, and proteins, and is influenced by environmental factors and component properties. Recent recognition of {LLPS} within living organisms reveals its role in creating cellular compartments to orchestrate complex biochemical reactions, requiring distinct boundaries and unhindered molecular movement. Nonmembrane compartments, stemming from cytoplasmic {LLPS}, such as nucleoli, hold promise for synthetic cell engineering and cellular function insights. Under certain conditions, {LLPS} is linked to diseases such as sickle-cell disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. This review offers a concise overview of {LLPS} in soft matter, emphasizing its relevance in soft material engineering. We delve into fundamental mechanisms, focusing on biological systems, and explore the implications of {LLPS}, spanning organelles, substance exchange, molecular diffusion, and disease associations. {LLPS} enables soft material engineering, with applications in biomedicine and bioengineering, shaping future possibilities in bioengineering, from foundational cellular constructs to intricate artificial tissue development.},
