	abstract = {We introduce {MolPhase}, an advanced algorithm for predicting protein phase separation ({PS}) behavior that improves accuracy and reliability by utilizing diverse physicochemical features and extensive experimental datasets. {MolPhase} applies a user-friendly interface to compare distinct biophysical features side-by-side along protein sequences. By additional comparison with structural predictions, {MolPhase} enables efficient predictions of new phase-separating proteins and guides hypothesis generation and experimental design. Key contributing factors underlying {MolPhase} include electrostatic pi-interactions, disorder, and prion-like domains. As an example, {MolPhase} finds that phytobacterial type {III} effectors (T3Es) are highly prone to homotypic {PS}, which was experimentally validated in vitro biochemically and in vivo in plants, mimicking their injection and accumulation in the host during microbial infection. The physicochemical characteristics of T3Es dictate their patterns of association for multivalent interactions, influencing the material properties of phase-separating droplets based on the surrounding microenvironment in vivo or in vitro. Robust integration of {MolPhase}’s effective prediction and experimental validation exhibit the potential to evaluate and explore how biomolecule {PS} functions in biological systems.},

	abstract = {The burgeoning comprehension of protein phase separation ({PS}) has ushered in a wealth of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of phase-separating proteins ({PSPs}). These tools often skew towards {PSPs} with a high content of intrinsically disordered regions ({IDRs}), thus frequently undervaluing potential {PSPs} without {IDRs}. Nonetheless, {PS} is not only steered by {IDRs} but also by the structured modular domains and interactions that aren’t necessarily reflected in amino acid sequences. In this work, we introduce {PSPire}, a machine learning predictor that incorporates both residue-level and structure-level features for the precise prediction of {PSPs}. Compared to current {PSP} predictors, {PSPire} shows a notable improvement in identifying {PSPs} without {IDRs}, which underscores the crucial role of non-{IDR}, structure-based characteristics in multivalent interactions throughout the {PS} process. Additionally, our biological validation experiments substantiate the predictive capacity of {PSPire}, with 9 out of 11 chosen candidate {PSPs} confirmed to form condensates within cells.},

Although the {LLPS} of biomolecules has been investigated intensively in recent years, the knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of phase separation proteins ({PSPs}) is still lag behind.

	abstract = {Intracellular phase separation of proteins into biomolecular condensates is increasingly recognized as a process with a key role in cellular compartmentalization and regulation. Different hypotheses about the parameters that determine the tendency of proteins to form condensates have been proposed, with some of them probed experimentally through the use of constructs generated by sequence alterations. To broaden the scope of these observations, we established an in silico strategy for understanding on a global level the associations between protein sequence and phase behavior and further constructed machine-learning models for predicting protein liquid–liquid phase separation ({LLPS}). Our analysis highlighted that {LLPS}-prone proteins are more disordered, less hydrophobic, and of lower Shannon entropy than sequences in the Protein Data Bank or the Swiss-Prot database and that they show a fine balance in their relative content of polar and hydrophobic residues. To further learn in a hypothesis-free manner the sequence features underpinning {LLPS}, we trained a neural network-based language model and found that a classifier constructed on such embeddings learned the underlying principles of phase behavior at a comparable accuracy to a classifier that used knowledge-based features. By combining knowledge-based features with unsupervised embeddings, we generated an integrated model that distinguished {LLPS}-prone sequences both from structured proteins and from unstructured proteins with a lower {LLPS} propensity and further identified such sequences from the human proteome at a high accuracy. These results provide a platform rooted in molecular principles for understanding protein phase behavior. The predictor, termed {DeePhase}, is accessible from https://deephase.ch.cam.ac.uk/.},

	abstract = {Many proteins perform their functions within membraneless organelles, where they form a liquid-like condensed state, also known as droplet state. The {FuzDrop} method predicts the probability of spontaneous liquid–liquid phase separation of proteins and provides a sequence-based score to identify the regions that promote this process. Furthermore, the {FuzDrop} method estimates the propensity of conversion of proteins to the amyloid state, and identifies aggregation hot-spots, which can drive the irreversible maturation of the liquid-like droplet state. These predictions can also identify mutations that can induce formation of amyloid aggregates, including those implicated in human diseases. To facilitate the interpretation of the predictions, the droplet-promoting and aggregation-promoting regions can be visualized on protein structures generated by {AlphaFold}. The {FuzDrop} server (https://fuzdrop.bio.unipd.it) thus offers insights into the complex behavior of proteins in their condensed states and facilitates the understanding of the functional relationships of proteins.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic cells contain different membrane-delimited compartments, which are crucial for the biochemical reactions necessary to sustain cell life. Recent studies showed that cells can also trigger the formation of membraneless organelles composed by phase-separated proteins to respond to various stimuli. These condensates provide new ways to control the reactions and phase-separation proteins ({PSPs}) are thus revolutionizing how cellular organization is conceived. The small number of experimentally validated proteins, and the difficulty in discovering them, remain bottlenecks in {PSPs} research.Here we present {PSPer}, the first in-silico screening tool for prion-like {RNA}-binding {PSPs}. We show that it can prioritize {PSPs} among proteins containing similar {RNA}-binding domains, intrinsically disordered regions and prions. {PSPer} is thus suitable to screen proteomes, identifying the most likely {PSPs} for further experimental investigation. Moreover, its predictions are fully interpretable in the sense that it assigns specific functional regions to the predicted proteins, providing valuable information for experimental investigation of targeted mutations on these regions. Finally, we show that it can estimate the ability of artificially designed proteins to form condensates (r=−0.87), thus providing an in-silico screening tool for protein design experiments.{PSPer} is available at bio2byte.com/psp.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
