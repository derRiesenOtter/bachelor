	abstract = {The burgeoning comprehension of protein phase separation ({PS}) has ushered in a wealth of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of phase-separating proteins ({PSPs}). These tools often skew towards {PSPs} with a high content of intrinsically disordered regions ({IDRs}), thus frequently undervaluing potential {PSPs} without {IDRs}. Nonetheless, {PS} is not only steered by {IDRs} but also by the structured modular domains and interactions that aren’t necessarily reflected in amino acid sequences. In this work, we introduce {PSPire}, a machine learning predictor that incorporates both residue-level and structure-level features for the precise prediction of {PSPs}. Compared to current {PSP} predictors, {PSPire} shows a notable improvement in identifying {PSPs} without {IDRs}, which underscores the crucial role of non-{IDR}, structure-based characteristics in multivalent interactions throughout the {PS} process. Additionally, our biological validation experiments substantiate the predictive capacity of {PSPire}, with 9 out of 11 chosen candidate {PSPs} confirmed to form condensates within cells.},

	abstract = {Protein self-assembly is one of the formation mechanisms of biomolecular condensates. However, most phase-separating systems ({PS}) demand multiple partners in biological conditions. In this study, we divided {PS} proteins into two groups according to the mechanism by which they undergo {PS}: {PS}-Self proteins can self-assemble spontaneously to form droplets, while {PS}-Part proteins interact with partners to undergo {PS}. Analysis of the amino acid composition revealed differences in the sequence pattern between the two protein groups. Existing {PS} predictors, when evaluated on two test protein sets, preferentially predicted self-assembling proteins. Thus, a comprehensive predictor is required. Herein, we propose that properties other than sequence composition can provide crucial information in screening {PS} proteins. By incorporating phosphorylation frequencies and immunofluorescence image-based droplet-forming propensity with other {PS}-related features, we built two independent machine-learning models to separately predict the two protein categories. Results of independent testing suggested the superiority of integrating multimodal features. We performed experimental verification on the top-scored proteins {DHX}9, Ki-67, and {NIFK}. Their {PS} behavior in vitro revealed the effectiveness of our models in {PS} prediction. Further validation on the proteome of membraneless organelles confirmed the ability of our models to identify {PS}-Part proteins. We implemented a web server named {PhaSePred} (http://predict.phasep.pro/) that incorporates our two models together with representative {PS} predictors. {PhaSePred} displays proteome-level quantiles of different features, thus profiling {PS} propensity and providing crucial information for identification of candidate proteins.},
