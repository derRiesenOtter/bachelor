== Current status of phase separation prediction
- Many Phase Separation Predictors have emerged, yet the performance is still
  not optimal
  - the best ones use scalar features (e.g. percentage of IDR)
- Problems are:
  - Lacking Training Data
  - Bias towards proteins containing IDRs
- Idea:
  - Using the sequence (block decomposition) to predict PS and try a newly
    published data set

== Repetition - Block Decomposition
- The block decomposition algorithm takes a protein sequence and a mapping
- It outputs a list of blocks that all have a certain word balance ("uniformity")
- Steps to use it for neural networks:
  - Adjusting the output
  - Finding relevant mappings

== Adjusting the output of the block decomposition algorithm

The block decomposition algorithm was modified to yield an output that can be
used in a neural network:

#place(left, block(width: 50%)[*Old Output*: \
[(5, 14),(15, 22)...]])
#place(right, block(width: 50%)[*New Output*: \
[0,0,0,0,1,1,1,...,2,2,2...]])

#v(25%)
- The list of tuples was converted to one list representing the sequence.
- Labels were created, representing the most common group(s).

== Finding meaningful mappings
Seven Mappings were found (in literature) that relate to phase separation or are generally
meaningful:
#align(center, table(
  columns: 1,
  "Aliphatic - Aromatic - Positive - Negative",
  "RG-Mappings (two separate)",
  "IDR-Mapping",
  "Most meaningful 5 mapping",
  "PiPi-Mapping (two separate)"
))
Those were used to generate one block decomposition for each mapping per
protein.

== Data sets I
For now two different data sets were used:
- PPMCLABs llps data set
  - created in an effort to create a dataset with an appropriate negative data
    set (many studies use RCSB Protein Data Bank, which are not guaranteed to be
    non phase separating)
  // - this model also classifies the positive proteins into _driver_ (proteins
  //   that can undergo PS on their own) and _client_
  //   (proteins recruited to the preexisting site)
  - contains 746 positive and 2077 negative entries
#place(diagram())

// == Data sets II
// - PhaSePred data set
//   - used to train the two tools SaPS and PdPS, addressed the difficulty of
//     predicting phase separating proteins that are _partner dependent_
//   - uses proteins that are not annotated as PS as negatives
//   - contains 567 positive and around 60,000 negative entries

== Data sets II
- PSPires data set
  - used to train PSPire, a recent well performing PS predictor addressing the
    difficulty of predicting phase separating proteins with no IDRs
  // - similar to PhaSePred data set, but less negative entries
  - contains 517 positive and around 10,000 negative entries

// == Main Goals
// #align(center, diagram(
//   spacing: (2mm, 4mm),
//   node((0, 0), [Check if deep learning models are able to learn PS prediction], shape: pill, fill: rgb(150, 200, 200)),
//   node((0, 1), [Check if the block decomposition is beneficial over the sequence alone], shape: pill, fill: rgb(150, 200, 200)),

// ))

== Test if a simple cnn model can learn from the data
To see if a cnn model was able to learn a basic 1 layer model
was created and run on the PPMCLAB data set:
#place(left, image("figures/cnn1l_bd_ppmclab_cm.png", width: 35%))
#place(center, image("figures/cnn1l_bd_ppmclab_rocauc.png", width: 33%))
#place(right, image("figures/cnn1l_bd_ppmclab_prauc.png", width: 33%))

== Testing different models
As the CNN2l model performed relatively good and was relatively quick in training it
was used for further tests:
#align(center, diagram(
  spacing: (3mm, 10mm),

  edge((2, 1), (2, 3), "-"),
  node((2, 3), [CNN2L + BiLSTM], shape: pill, fill: red, stroke: black),
))

// == Block Decomposition vs Sequence
// The models based on the sequence instead of the block decomposition outperformed
// their counterparts, eg. CNN2L trained and tested on PSPire data set:
//
// #align(center, table(
//   columns: 5,
//   "",      table.cell(colspan: 2)[#text(red)[Block Decomposition]], table.cell(colspan: 2)[#text(green)[Sequence]],
//   "",      "IDR",           "nIDR",                                 "IDR",             "nIDR",
//   "AUROC", text(red)[0.70], text(red)[0.62],                        text(green)[0.74], text(green)[0.64],
//   "PRAUC", text(red)[0.22], "0.05",                                 text(green)[0.26], "0.05",
// ))
//
// == Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning model
// To see if a model like XGBoost is able to use the data created by the block
// decomposition, a simple model was created and compared to the deep learning
// model. It compared very similar to the block decomposition model (PSPire data
// set):
//
// #align(center, table(
//   columns: 4,
//   "",      "XGBoost", "CNN2L BD", "CNN2L SEQ",
//   "AUROC", "0.69",    "0.68",     "0.71",
//   "PRAUC", "0.24",    "0.24",     "0.28"
// ))
//
// == BiLSTM and Transformer
// Both models were not able to outperform the CNN2L model.

== Results in context of the initial idea of this work
- block decomposition can be used to predict phase separation
- but using the raw sequence yields better results
- therefore the focus has shifted to using the sequence and additional data to
  build a good phase separation predictor

== Visualizing the results
- ROC AUC and PR AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- F1 Scores, Accuracy etc.
- bar plots / tables for comparison with other tools

== What can / should be done in the remaining time?
- Add post translational modification data
- Cross validation of the final model
- Comparison of PSPire and my tool on the PPMCLAB data
- If there is time left, check for Driver and Client differences

//
// == Data Preparation
// The datasets were filtered for:
// - sequence length: only sequences smaller than 2700 residues
// - unknown amino acid annotations: sequences containing letters that did not fit
//   into the mappings were filtered out
//
// == Most basic model I
// To see if a convolutional neural network is able to learn, a very basic model was
// created. It had the following structure (80/20 train/test split):
// + Embedding Layer, creating an embedding for each of the block decompositions
// + Convolutional Layer
// + ReLu Activation Layer
// + MaxPoolingLayer
// + GlobalPoolingLayer
// + Dropout layer
// + Linear Layer (Fully Connected)
//
// == Most basic model II
// The first run showed, that the model is able to learn from the data.

// #place(right, image("figures/cnn1l_bd_ppmclab_prauc.png", width: 33%))
//
// == Comparison with only the sequence
// To see if the block decomposition yielded a benefit over feeding the model with
// the raw sequence as input, a model using only the sequence was created and run:

//
// == Comparison to PSPire
// To compare the performance of this simple model to the performance of PSPire,
// the model was trained and validated on the same data.
//
// #align(center, table(
//   columns: 7,

// ))
//
// Second best predictor (PdPS): \
// *IDR* AUROC:0.84 PRAUC:0.42, *nIDR* AUROC: 0.68,
// PRAUC: 0.08
//
// == Conclusion for the simple model
// While both models did not perform too well, they already outperformed many older
// predictors for the nIDR proteins. The model using the block decomposition
// however performed significantly worse than the model that used only the
// sequence.
//
// A second model was created with an additional convolutional layer (+activation,
// +pooling).

// == Conclusion for the 2 convolutional layer model
// Both models benefited from the additional layer, especially the model using the

//
// == Introducing RSA
// What helped PSPire to outperform the other predictors was the inclusion of

// == Data Preparation
// The datasets were filtered for:
// - sequence length: only sequences smaller than 2700 residues
// - unknown amino acid annotations: sequences containing letters that did not fit
//   into the mappings were filtered out
//
// == Most basic model I
// To see if a convolutional neural network is able to learn, a very basic model was
// created. It had the following structure (80/20 train/test split):
// + Embedding Layer, creating an embedding for each of the block decompositions
// + Convolutional Layer
// + ReLu Activation Layer
// + MaxPoolingLayer
// + GlobalPoolingLayer
// + Dropout layer
// + Linear Layer (Fully Connected)
//
// == Most basic model II
// The first run showed, that the model is able to learn from the data.
// #place(left, image("figures/cnn1l_bd_ppmclab_cm.png", width: 33%))
// #place(center, image("figures/cnn1l_bd_ppmclab_rocauc.png", width: 33%))
// #place(right, image("figures/cnn1l_bd_ppmclab_prauc.png", width: 33%))
//
// == Comparison with only the sequence
// To see if the block decomposition yielded a benefit over feeding the model with
// the raw sequence as input, a model using only the sequence was created and run:
//
// #place(left, image("figures/run_cnn1l_ppmclab_cm.png", width: 33%))
// #place(center, image("figures/run_cnn1l_ppmclab_rocauc.png", width: 33%))
// #place(right, image("figures/run_cnn1l_ppmclab_prauc.png", width: 33%))
//
// == Comparison to PSPire
// To compare the performance of this simple model to the performance of PSPire,
// the model was trained and validated on the same data.
//
// #align(center, table(
//   columns: 7,

//
// Second best predictor (PdPS): \
// *IDR* AUROC:0.84 PRAUC:0.42, *nIDR* AUROC: 0.68,
// PRAUC: 0.08
//
// == Conclusion for the simple model
// While both models did not perform too well, they already outperformed many older
// predictors for the nIDR proteins. The model using the block decomposition
// however performed significantly worse than the model that used only the
// sequence.
//
// A second model was created with an additional convolutional layer (+activation,
// +pooling).

//
// == Conclusion for the 2 convolutional layer model
// Both models benefited from the additional layer, especially the model using the
// block decomposition. In the end the sequence model still outperformed it.
// As a next step the introduction of other layers was tested (bilstm and
// transformer).

// == Introducing RSA
// What helped PSPire to outperform the other predictors was the inclusion of
// structural predictions of the proteins. They divided did calculate the features
// for the IDRs and the ordered regions separately. For the ordered regions they
// only used the amino acids with an *Relative Surface Availability* greater than
// 0.25.

// as an additional feature.
