	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Eukaryotic cells organize their intracellular components into organelles that can be membrane-bound or membraneless. A large number of membraneless organelles, including nucleoli, Cajal bodies, P-bodies, and stress granules, exist as liquid droplets within the cell and arise from the condensation of cellular material in a process termed liquid–liquid phase separation ({LLPS}). Beyond a mere organizational tool, concentrating cellular components into membraneless organelles tunes biochemical reactions and improves cellular fitness during stress. In this review, we provide an overview of the molecular underpinnings of the formation and regulation of these membraneless organelles. This molecular understanding explains emergent properties of these membraneless organelles and shines new light on neurodegenerative diseases, which may originate from disturbances in {LLPS} and membraneless organelles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that liquid–liquid phase separation ({LLPS}) represents a vital and ubiquitous phenomenon underlying the formation of membraneless organelles in eukaryotic cells (also known as biomolecular condensates or droplets). Recent studies have revealed evidences that indicate that {LLPS} plays a vital role in human health and diseases. In this review, we describe our current understanding of {LLPS} and summarize its physiological functions. We further describe the role of {LLPS} in the development of human diseases. Additionally, we review the recently developed methods for studying {LLPS}. Although {LLPS} research is in its infancy—but is fast-growing—it is clear that {LLPS} plays an essential role in the development of pathophysiological conditions. This highlights the need for an overview of the recent advances in the field to translate our current knowledge regarding {LLPS} into therapeutic discoveries.},

	abstract = {Protein self-assembly is one of the formation mechanisms of biomolecular condensates. However, most phase-separating systems ({PS}) demand multiple partners in biological conditions. In this study, we divided {PS} proteins into two groups according to the mechanism by which they undergo {PS}: {PS}-Self proteins can self-assemble spontaneously to form droplets, while {PS}-Part proteins interact with partners to undergo {PS}. Analysis of the amino acid composition revealed differences in the sequence pattern between the two protein groups. Existing {PS} predictors, when evaluated on two test protein sets, preferentially predicted self-assembling proteins. Thus, a comprehensive predictor is required. Herein, we propose that properties other than sequence composition can provide crucial information in screening {PS} proteins. By incorporating phosphorylation frequencies and immunofluorescence image-based droplet-forming propensity with other {PS}-related features, we built two independent machine-learning models to separately predict the two protein categories. Results of independent testing suggested the superiority of integrating multimodal features. We performed experimental verification on the top-scored proteins {DHX}9,
              K
              i
              -67, and {NIFK}. Their {PS} behavior in vitro revealed the effectiveness of our models in {PS} prediction. Further validation on the proteome of membraneless organelles confirmed the ability of our models to identify {PS}-Part proteins. We implemented a web server named {PhaSePred} (
              http://predict.phasep.pro/
              ) that incorporates our two models together with representative {PS} predictors. {PhaSePred} displays proteome-level quantiles of different features, thus profiling {PS} propensity and providing crucial information for identification of candidate proteins.},

	abstract = {The burgeoning comprehension of protein phase separation ({PS}) has ushered in a wealth of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of phase-separating proteins ({PSPs}). These tools often skew towards {PSPs} with a high content of intrinsically disordered regions ({IDRs}), thus frequently undervaluing potential {PSPs} without {IDRs}. Nonetheless, {PS} is not only steered by {IDRs} but also by the structured modular domains and interactions that aren’t necessarily reflected in amino acid sequences. In this work, we introduce {PSPire}, a machine learning predictor that incorporates both residue-level and structure-level features for the precise prediction of {PSPs}. Compared to current {PSP} predictors, {PSPire} shows a notable improvement in identifying {PSPs} without {IDRs}, which underscores the crucial role of non-{IDR}, structure-based characteristics in multivalent interactions throughout the {PS} process. Additionally, our biological validation experiments substantiate the predictive capacity of {PSPire}, with 9 out of 11 chosen candidate {PSPs} confirmed to form condensates within cells.},
