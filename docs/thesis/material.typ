The protein sequences for the PSPire dataset and the PhaSepDB were downloaded
from UniProt @the_uniprot_consortium_uniprot_2025. The structural data used to
calculate the relative surface availability was downloaded from AlphaFold
@jumper_highly_2021. The posttranslational modification data was also
downloaded from UniProt @the_uniprot_consortium_uniprot_2025.

In the following sections the composition of the data sets, other details and
the reason why this data set was used are described.

== PhaSePred Data Set

The data set to develop the PhaSePred model contains proteins of 49 organisms.
They were taken mainly from PhaSepDB. Some were also taken from LLPSDB
@wang_llpsdb_2022 and PhaSePro @meszaros_phasepro_2020. To reduce redundancy
the CD-HIT @fu_cd-hit_2012 algorithm was used. The positive proteins consist of 201
self-assembling proteins and 327 partner-dependent proteins. The positive
training set consisted of 128 self-assembling and 214 partner-dependent
proteins. The remaining positives were used for independent testing.

The negative datasets consists of 10 of the proteomes (_Homo sapiens_,
_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_, _Mus musculus_, _Drosophila melanogaster_,
_Caenorhabditis elegans_, _Rattus norvegicus_, _Xenopus laevis_, _Arabidosis
thaliana_, _Escherichia coli_, _Schizosaccharomyces pombe_) that are present in
the training data set. The CD-HIT algorithm was again used to reduce
redundancy. 60,251 proteins remained. 20 % were used in the testing set, while
the other 80 % were used in the training set.

This data set was used to test the influence of grouping @llps
proteins into the two categories of self-assembling and partner-dependent
@llps proteins.

== PSPire Data Set

The PSPire data set is based on the data set of the PhaSePred models. It also
incorporates proteins from LLPSDB @wang_llpsdb_2022, PhaSePro
@meszaros_phasepro_2020, PhaSepDB @hou_phasepdb_2023, and DRLLPS
@ning_drllps_2020. The PSPire training data set contains 259 positives with 195
containing at least one IDR and 64 without one and 8323 negative entries. The
testing data set contains 258 positive entries with 194 containing at least one
IDR and 64 without one and 1961 negative entries.

For evaluation, five human @mlo datasets were collected: G3BP1 proximity
labeling set, DACT1-particulate proteome set, RNAgranuleDB Tier1 set and the
PhaSepDB low and high throughput MLO set and the DRLLPS MLO set.

This data set was used because of its focus on @llps proteins that contain
no @idr and because it enables a broad comparison between many tools due
to its evaluation on @mlo data sets.

== PPMC-lab Data Set

The PPMC-lab data set was created to help developing better Phase Separation
Predictors. It tries to solve the challenge of the selection of an appropriate
negative training data set. Current models use negative data sets that do not
contain experimentally tested negatives. This data set also differentiates between
driver and client.
It contains 784 positives, where 367 are clients, 358 are drivers and 59 are both.
The negative set contains 2121 proteins where 1120 are structured proteins and 1001
are disordered proteins. The proteins are collected from DRLLPS
@ning_drllps_2020, LLPSDB @wang_llpsdb_2022, PhaSepDB @hou_phasepdb_2023,
PhaSePro @meszaros_phasepro_2020, CD-Code @rostam_cd-code_2023, DisProt
@aspromonte_disprot_2024 and PDB @berman_protein_2000.

The PPMC-lab data set was chosen because it provides a curated negative data set.

== CatGranule 2.0 Data set
The CatGranule 2.0 data set consists of 3333 positive and 3252 negative
proteins in the training data set and 1422 positives and 1376 negatives in the
testing data set. The sources of the proteins are similar to the other data
sets and include PhaSepDB @hou_phasepdb_2023, PhaSePro @meszaros_phasepro_2020,
LLPSDB @wang_llpsdb_2022, CD-Code @rostam_cd-code_2023, DRLLPS
@ning_drllps_2020 as well as data from the PRALINE database @vandelli_praline_2023, proteins from
previous @llps predictors @kuechler_comparison_2023 and from an article about
properties of stress granule and P-body proteomes @youn_properties_2019. Like the
previous studies CD-Hit was used to filter out too similar proteins. The negative
data set is created by using the human proteome and excluding the proteins of the
positive data set and their first interactors. @monti_catgranule_2025

This data set was used to be able to compare the tool created in this work with newer @llps
predictors that claim to be the top performing state-of-the art methods. This includes
CatGranule 2.0, MaGS, PICNIC, and PICNIC-GO. @monti_catgranule_2025
