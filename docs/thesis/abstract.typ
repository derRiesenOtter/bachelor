Liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins is a fundamental cellular
mechanism responsible for compartmentalization without membrane boundaries. It
also plays a role in the development of certain diseases. Computational
prediction of LLPS propensity helps in understanding protein interactions in
cellular contexts where experimental data is lacking.

This work presents a novel sequence-based predictor for Liquid-Liquid Phase
Separation proteins using Neural Networks. In addition to raw amino acid
sequences, a block decomposition of these sequences was explored as main input.
Various Neural Network architectures were evaluated, including Convolutional
Neural Networks, Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory models, and Transformers.
The model was further enhanced with additional features such as Relative
Solvent Availability and Post Translational Modifications. Unlike existing
Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation predictors that rely on conventional Machine
Learning models and therefore use tabular inputs, this approach enables the
direct use of sequence data.

The results demonstrate that even relatively simple Neural Network
architectures can match the performance of current state-of-the-art predictors.
The usage of the Raw sequences proved to be better than using the block
decomposition. While Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation prediction remains
challenging due to limited experimental data and complex biological mechanisms,
this study suggests that sequence-based Neural Network models hold strong
potential. As more data becomes available, such models may define the next
generation of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation predictors.
