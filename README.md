# Prediction of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of Proteins using Neural Networks

This repository houses the raw data and scripts that were used during 
my bachelor thesis. 

The structure of this repository is shown below:

```sh

│   └── raw_data  
├── docs

├── requirements.txt  
├── results  
│   ├── plots  
│   ├── stdout  
└── src  
    ├── modules  
    └── scripts  

```
  
The lab book houses all information about which script was run at what time 
as well as the goal of the run. 

The plots folder is empty as there where too many images to upload them all to 
github. If one wishes to recreate the plots (they contain the evaluation metrics 
such as ROCAUC and PRCAUC) he has to rerun the script and scripts it depends on.
